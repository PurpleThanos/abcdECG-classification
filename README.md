# ðŸ©º ECG Classification Web App

This is a deep learning web application that classifies ECG images into different heart condition categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The app is built using **Streamlit** and is designed for users to easily upload ECG images and get real-time predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Upload `.jpg` or `.png` ECG images
- Predict heart conditions using a trained CNN model
- Generate a diagnosis PDF report
- User-friendly Streamlit interface

---

## ðŸ§  Model Details

- Trained using a CNN with Keras/TensorFlow
- Based on image data from a publicly available ECG dataset
- Saved model: `ecg_model.h5`
